# Idling is dictated by the following behavior:
# - 150 second timeout (2 minutes 30 seconds) -> reduce brightness to 10%; reset brightness back to where it was on resumption
# - 300 second timeout (5 minutes) -> lock session
# - 330 second timeout (5 minutes 30 seconds) -> turn off display; turn on display on resumption
# - 900 second timeout (15 minutes) -> suspend system
